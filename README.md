- Hi, I’m Amol. I'm a non-coder (Just high level understanding of python, C, Linux, HTML, CSS, JS, Django, SQL).
- Freelance project manager
- 3x Meta Certified Digital/Social-Media Marketer (pursuing Meta Marketing Science + Meta Data Analyst Certifications).
- I'm here on a quest to create everything purely based on natural language prompt using all the popular offerings like Gemini, Grok, ChatGPT, Claude. Let's see how good they actually are.
- I’m interested in web-development, pthon programming, linux/unix.
- Currently working on developing Rust Kernel from ground up on my own geometric logic (in my opinion it is my logic, but I could be 100% wrong).
- Feel free to contribute, critique, help, correct or guide me. I'm all ears.
- How to reach me : amol.jassal@gmail.com
