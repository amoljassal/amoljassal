- 👋 Hi, I’m Amol
- 👀 I’m interested in web-development, pthon programming, linux/unix.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web-development on udemy through a course created by Dr. Angela Yu.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner level projects where I can learn better by doing rather than passively learning.
